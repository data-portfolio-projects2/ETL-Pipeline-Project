# ETL-Pipeline-Project
A robust ETL pipeline designed to extract Salesforce data using Dask, perform automated data validation, clean and transform valid records, and prepare outputs for dashboard ingestion. Invalid or mixed-type records are isolated for manual review to ensure data quality without altering the original files.
